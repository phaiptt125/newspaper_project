    "## Additional amendments\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we made additional amendments as the following (see [here](https://ssc.wisc.edu/~eatalay/apst/apst_mapping.pdf) for more detail):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We assign an SOC code of 999999 (“missing”) if certain words or phrases appear — “associate,” “career builder,” “liberal employee benefit,” “many employee benefit,” or “personnel” — anywhere in the job title, or for certain exact titles: “boys,” “boys boys,” “men boys girls,” “men boys girls women,” “men boys men,” “people,” “professional,” or “trainee.” These words and phrases appear commonly in our newspaper ads and do not refer to the SOC code which our CBOW model indicates. “Associate” commonly appears the part of the name of the firms which are placing the ad. “Personnel” commonly refers to the personnel department to which the applicant should contact.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We also replace the SOC code for the job title “Assistant” from 399021 (the SOC code for “Personal Care Aides”) to 436014 (the SOC code for “Secretaries and Administrative Assistants”). “Assistant” is the fifth most common job title, and judging by the text within the job ads refers to a secretarial occupation rather than one for a personal care worker. While we are hesitant to modify our job title to SOC mapping in an ad hoc fashion for any job title, mis-specifying this mapping for such a common title would have a noticeably deleterious impact on our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In a final step, we amend the output of the CBOW model for a few ambiguously defined job titles. These final amendments have no discernible impact on aggregate trends in task content, on role within-occupation shifts in accounting for aggregate task changes, or on the role of shifts in the demand for tasks in accounting for increased earnings inequality. First, for job titles which include “server” and which do not also include a food-service-related word — banquet, bartender, cashier, cocktail, cook, dining, food, or restaurant — we substitute an SOC code beginning with 3530 with the SOC code for computer systems analysts (151121). Second, for job titles which contain the word “programmer,” do not include the words “cnc” or “machine,” we substitute SOC codes beginning with 5140 or 5141 with the SOC code for computer programmers (151131). Finally, for job titles which contain the word “assembler” and do not contain a word referring to manufacturing assembly work — words containing the strings electronic, electric, machin, mechanical, metal, and wire — we substitute SOC codes beginning with 5120 with the SOC code of computer programmers (151131). The amendments, which alter the SOC codes for approximately 0.2 percent of ads in our data set, are necessary for ongoing work in which we explore the role of new technologies in the labor market. Certain words refer both to a job title unrelated to new technologies as well as to new technologies. By linking the aforementioned job titles to SOCs that have no exposure to new technologies, we would be vastly overstating the rates at which food service staff or manufacturing production workers adopt new ICT software. On the other hand, since these 8 ads represent a small portion of the ads referring to computer programmer occupations, lumping the ambiguous job titles with the computer programmer SOC codes will only have a minor effect on the assessed technology adoption rates for computer programmers."
